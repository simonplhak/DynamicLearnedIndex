# Dynamic Learned Index implementation in Rust

A Rust implementation of a dynamic learned index for efficient search in unstructured data. The index uses a multi-level structure where each level contains a neural network model that learns to predict the most likely bucket containing the requested data. This enables fast approximate nearest neighbor search by leveraging learned models instead of traditional indexing.

## Dev

The whole project is written in Rust and uses `cargo` as a build system. The project is divided into several crates:

- `dynamic_learned_index`: main library crate that implements the dynamic learned index
- `cli_dynamic_learned_index`: CLI crate that provides a command line interface to run experiments and build the index
- `py_dynamic_learned_index`: Python crate that provides a Python interface to the dynamic learned index
- `measure_time_macro`: Simple macro that enables logging time of the function through macro.

### Run

```shell
cargo run -p cli_dynamic_learned_index
```

## Build

If you want to build the `cli_dynamic_learned_index` workspace, you need to have hdf5 library installed on your system. You can install it via your package manager.

### Feature flags

**dynamic_learned_index** crate:

- `measure_time`: enables time measuring macro, mostly for development purposes
- `tch`: enables the use of `tch-rs` library for model training
  - You need to have `libtorch` installed on your system to use this feature. Follow the installation instructions for `libtorch` from [tch-rs homepage](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs).
- `candle`: enabled by default, enables the use of `candle` library for model training
- `mkl`: enables the use of `mkl` library for linear algebra operations, can be used with `candle` feature to speed up training on CPU
- `mix`: enables the use of mixed model of `tch` (training) and `candle` (predictions).

**Note** It's not possible 

**cli_dynamic_learned_index** crate:

- `measure_time`: enables time measuring macro, mostly for development purposes
- `kmeans`: just for running benchmarks for kmeans implementation, not used in the main codebase
- `kentro`: just for running benchmarks for kentro implementation, not used in the main codebase

**py_dynamic_learned_index* crate:

- `measure_time`: enables time measuring macro, mostly for development purposes
- `mkl`: enables the use of `mkl` library for linear algebra operations, can be used with `candle` feature to speed up training on CPU
- `tch`: enables the use of `tch-rs` library for model training, can be used with `candle` feature to speed up training on CPU
- `candle`: enables the use of `candle` library for model training, can be used with `mkl` or `tch` features to speed up training on CPU

### Linking with Python

To link the Rust library with Python, we use `maturin` to build a Python package. This allows us to use the Rust code as a Python module.

Setup python environment

```shell
cd py_dynamic_learned_index
uv sync
uv run maturin develop --release
python -c "import py_dynamic_learned_index; print(py_dynamic_learned_index.__version__)"  # test installation
```

Then you can install the package via pip:

```shell
pip install ./target/wheels/py_dynamic_learned_index*.whl
```

Building the wheel in release mode:

```shell
cd py_dynamic_learned_index
uv sync
uv run maturin build --release
uv pip install ./target/wheels/py_dynamic_learned_index*.whl
```

## Running experiments via CLI

### Dataset

```yaml
dataset:
  type: <type>
  value:
    path: <path>
    dataset_name: <dataset_name>
queries:
  type: <type>
  value:
    path: <path>
    dataset_name: <dataset_name>
ground_truth:
  type: <type>
  value:
    path: <path>
    dataset_name: <dataset_name>
```

`<dataset_name>`: name of the underlining dataset under h5

`<type>`: type of the dataset, can be `h5`

`<path>`: path to the dataset file relative from dataset config directory.

Default values can be found via `cli_dynamic_learned_index defaults dataset` command.

### Index

Example config:

```yaml
# Compaction strategy configuration
compaction_strategy:
  type: bentley_saxe              # Strategy for managing level transitions (only option)
  rebuild_strategy: no_rebuild    # How to rebuild during compaction: no_rebuild, basic_rebuild, or greedy_rebuild

# Level configuration (repeated for multiple levels if needed)
levels:
  # Neural network model configuration
  model:
    # Neural network layers (add more layers as needed, always adds output layer automatically)
    layers:
      - type: linear              # Linear transformation layer
        value: 256                # Output dimensions
      - type: relu                # ReLU activation layer
    
    # Model training parameters
    train_params:
      threshold_samples: 1000     # Minimum samples required before training
      batch_size: 8               # Samples per training batch
      epochs: 3                   # Number of training passes
      max_iters: 10               # Maximum iterations for clustering
      retrain_strategy: no_retrain  # When to retrain: no_retrain or from_scratch
    
    # Optional: path to pre-trained model weights
    weights_path: null            # Load model weights from file
    
    # Optional: enable model quantization for compression
    quantize: false               # Reduce model precision to int8
    
    # Optional: random seed for reproducibility
    seed: 0                       # Seed for random number generation
  
  # Storage configuration for this level
  bucket_size: 5000               # Maximum records per bucket before split

# Global index configuration
buffer_size: 5000                 # Size of write buffer before flushing to index
input_shape: 768                  # Dimension of input vectors
arity: 3                          # Fanout for compaction (max child nodes per parent)
device: cpu                       # Compute device: cpu or cuda (cuda requires tch feature)
distance_fn: dot                  # Distance metric: dot (for cosine similarity) or l2 (euclidean)
delete_method: oid_to_bucket      # Deletion strategy (only option currently available)
```

**Configuration Notes:**

- `levels`: Index levels inherit from previous level until matched. First level is always 0. Omit levels field to use defaults for all levels.
- `layers`: Add as many layers as needed. Neural network automatically adds output layer based on model parameters.
- `distance_fn`: Choose `dot` for normalized embeddings (dot product), or `l2` for euclidean distance
- `rebuild_strategy`: `no_rebuild` (fastest), `basic_rebuild` (retrains models), `greedy_rebuild` (optimizes splits)
- `retrain_strategy`: `no_retrain` (use existing models), `from_scratch` (train all models from beginning)

Default values can be found via `cli_dynamic_learned_index defaults index` command.

### Running experiments

To run experiments via CLI, you can use the `cli_dynamic_learned_index` binary. Example:

```shell
./target/release/cli_dynamic_learned_index experiment test_build data/k300 --force
```

## Rust API

The `dynamic_learned_index` crate provides a public API for building and querying indices programmatically from Rust code.

```rust
use dynamic_learned_index::{Index, IndexBuilder, IndexConfig, SearchParams, SearchStrategy};

// Build an index with f32 float type
let mut index = IndexBuilder::<f32>::default()
    .input_shape(768)
    .buffer_size(5000)
    .bucket_size(5000)
    .arity(3)
    .build()?;

// Insert data
index.insert(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0)?;

// Search for k nearest neighbors
let query = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];
let results = index.search(&query, 10)?;
index.delete(0)?;
```

## Python API

This crate provides a Python API available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/py-dynamic-learned-index/

Example usage can be found in [`py_dynamic_learned_index/example.py`](py_dynamic_learned_index/example.py) directory.

## Docker

To run the project in a Docker container.

```shell
docker build -t dli-cli --exclude py_dynamic_learned_index .
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}/experiments_data:/app/experiments_data -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data -v ${PWD}/configs:/app/configs dli-cli
```

## Profiling

Recommended approach to optimize code is to go through cycle of measuring, analyzing and optimizing.

### Measurment

The measurment focuses on measuring search time. There are two measurements:

- for 3 individual queries (good for debugging)
- for the whole query set (good for overall performance measurment)

```shell
# ensure that you have built the latest release version
cargo build --release

# we need to build the index and serialize it
./target/release/cli_dynamic_learned_index experiment profiler  data/k300/ \
  -i configs/example.yaml \
  --skip-validation \
  --start-from-one \
  --force \
  --skip-search \
  --output-dir index_dump

# run benchmark and save as a baseline
cargo bench -p cli_dynamic_learned_index --bench index_benchmarks -- --warm-up-time 5 --measurement-time 15 --save-baseline base

# run benchmark and compare with the baseline
cargo bench -p cli_dynamic_learned_index --bench index_benchmarks -- --warm-up-time 5 --measurement-time 15 --baseline base 
```

Results are in `target/criterion/report/index.html` file.

```shell
# open the report
open target/criterion/report/index.html
```

### Analyzing

```shell
# ensure that you have built the latest release version
cargo build --release

# we need to build the index and serialize it
./target/release/cli_dynamic_learned_index experiment profiler  data/k300/ \
  -i configs/example.yaml \
  --skip-validation \
  --start-from-one \
  --log-output stdout \
  --force \
  --skip-search \
  --output-dir index_dump

# run profiler
# profiler will load the index from `index_dump` directory
# starts benchmark
# searches 100 queries and generate flamegraph
# ends benchmark
cargo run -p cli_dynamic_learned_index --example profiler
```

The flamegraph is stored in `flamegraph.svg` file. You can open it in a web browser.

```shell
# open the flamegraph 
google-chrome flamegraph.svg
```

### Benchmarks for individual implementations

To run benchmarks, use the following command:

```shell
cargo bench -p cli_dynamic_learned_index
```

In basic case there is just candle model benchmark. To run tch model benchmark, enable `tch` feature:

```shell
# model benchmarks are in dynamic_learned_index due to the visibility
cargo bench -p dynamic_learned_index --features tch
```
